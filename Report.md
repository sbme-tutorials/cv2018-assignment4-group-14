Otsu threshold Algorithm steps:

  1)Compute histogram and probabilities of each intensity level.
  2)Set up initial class probability and initial class means.
  3)Step through all possible thresholds maximum intensity.
  4)Update qi and Î¼i.
  5)Compute between class variance.
  6)Desired threshold corresponds to the maximum value of between class variance.
