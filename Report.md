Otsu threshold Algorithm steps:

  1)Compute histogram and probabilities of each intensity level.
  
  2)Set up initial class probability and initial class means.
  
  3)Step through all possible thresholds maximum intensity.
  
  4)Update qi and Î¼i.
  
  5)Compute between class variance.
  
  6)Desired threshold corresponds to the maximum value of between class variance.


Mean shift Algorithm steps:

 1) Compute mean shift vector

 2) Move the density estimation window
 
 3) Repeat till convergence
 
 
Region Growing Algorithm steps:

 (1) Choose the seed pixel

 (2) Check the neighboring pixels and add them to the region if they are similar to the seed

 (3) Repeat step 2 for each of the newly added pixels; stop if no more pixels can be added.
